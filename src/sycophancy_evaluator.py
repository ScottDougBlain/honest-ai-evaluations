"""
Non-Sycophantic Response Evaluation Framework

This module implements a comprehensive evaluation framework for preventing harmful
sycophancy in LLMs. Based on clinical psychology insights about the difference
between validation and reality-testing, this system measures and mitigates false
hope provision while maintaining emotional sensitivity.

The framework bridges clinical expertise in therapeutic honesty with AI safety
requirements for truthful, non-manipulative responses.
